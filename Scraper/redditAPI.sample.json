/*
This app uses https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/snoowrap to access reddit's API
To scrape Reddit we'll need to make an app with them which generates a "clientId" and a "clientSecret" take these and using Oauth you can generate a "refreshToken"
Honestly though just use this https://github.com/not-an-aardvark/reddit-oauth-helper It'll guide you through it give you your details which you can then dump in here
Don't wanna click a whole link?
Well then run
npm install -g reddit-oauth-helper
and then
reddit-oauth-helper
and awaaaayyy we go

Lastly remove the .sample part of this files name to get running
